Revision history for POE::Component::Client::HTTP
=================================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

---------------
0.35 2000.09.20
---------------

Added cookies support, and documented the CookieJar parameter for
PoCo::Client::HTTP->spawn().

---------------
0.34 2000.09.02
---------------

On crysflame's recommendation, I moved the HTTP.pm file out of
POE/Component/Client and added a PM directive to Makefile.PL.  Now
HTTP.pm gets installed.  Fixed the MANIFEST and cleaned up Makefile.PL
a little while I was in there.

---------------
0.33 2000.09.01
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.33 to indicate the
author's confidence in its completion (that is, it's about 1/3 of the
way).  It works for simple GET and POST requests; others may also
work, but they haven't been tested.
